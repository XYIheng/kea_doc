Quick example
==============

If you have downloaded our project and configured the environment, you only need to enter "example/" to execute our sample property with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    cd example
    kea -f example.py -a omninotes.apk -t 100


That's it! 

``-f``: the file path of the property

``-a``: the file path of the apk

``-t``: the timeout of this execution(seconds).

Finally, you can see the test results ``bug_report.html`` in the "output" directory.
